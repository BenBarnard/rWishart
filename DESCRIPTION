Description: An expansion of R's base random wishart matrix generation. This 
  package allows the user to generate singular and pseudo wishart matrices. 
  In addition the user can generate wishart matrices with fractional degrees of 
  freedom commonly used in volatility modeling. Users can also use this package 
  to create random covariance matrices.
