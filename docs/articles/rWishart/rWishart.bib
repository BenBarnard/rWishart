	abstract = {A comprehensive examination of high-dimensional analysis of multivariate methods and their real-world applications Multivariate Statistics: High-Dimensional and Large-Sample Approximations is the first book of its kind to explore how classical multivariate methods can be revised and used in place of conventional statistical tools. Written by prominent researchers in the field, the book focuses on high-dimensional and large-scale approximations and details the many basic multivariate methods used to achieve high levels of accuracy. The authors begin with a fundamental presentation of the basic tools and exact distributional results of multivariate statistics, and, in addition, the derivations of most distributional results are provided. Statistical methods for high-dimensional data, such as curve data, spectra, images, and DNA microarrays, are discussed. Bootstrap approximations from a methodological point of view, theoretical accuracies in MANOVA tests, and model selection criteria are also presented. Subsequent chapters feature additional topical coverage including:  High-dimensional approximations of various statistics High-dimensional statistical methods Approximations with computable error bound Selection of variables based on model selection approach Statistics with error bounds and their appearance in discriminant analysis, growth curve models, generalized linear models, profile analysis, and multiple comparison  Each chapter provides real-world applications and thorough analyses of the real data. In addition, approximation formulas found throughout the book are a useful tool for both practical and theoretical statisticians, and basic results on exact distributions in multivariate analysis are included in a comprehensive, yet accessible, format. Multivariate Statistics is an excellent book for courses on probability theory in statistics at the graduate level. It is also an essential reference for both practical and theoretical statisticians who are interested in multivariate analysis and who would benefit from learning the applications of analytical probabilistic methods in statistics.},

The density function is found for all rank-n Wishart distributions as well as the rank-1 multivariate beta distribution. To do that, the Jacobian for the transformation to the singular value decomposition of general m × n matrices is calculated. The results in this paper are useful in particular for updating a Bayesian posterior when tracking a time-varying variance-covariance matrix.},

Two techniques are proposed for evaluating the Jacobians of certain transformations, one based on a theorem on Jacobians [1], and the second based on the introduction of pseudo or extra variables. This matrix approach has a geometrical analog developed in part by one of the authors [2]. Section 3 is concerned with a discussion of these two techniques; in Section 4, the former is applied to obtain the joint distribution of the rectangular coordinates [3], and in Section 5, the second method is applied to obtain the joint distribution of the roots of a determinantal equation [4], [5], [6], and [7].},
